### Notes:

* Design
    * React-scroll: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll>
    * slick.co: <http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/>

* Program
    * [Passing props to components in routes] <https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/4105>

* Superagent
    * <https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/>
    

* Promises
    * Really good practice w promises thus far -- remember to **return** request if you need your call to wait for a return value!
    * *Promise.all()*
        * Used this method to tell the program to wait for all ids to be pushed to an array before mapping
